CHAT BOT APP
Overview
This Chat Bot App is a web-based application built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. The chat bot is designed to interact with users by processing their input and generating appropriate responses. 

To start with, I used Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model that can generate human-like responses to given prompts. I integrated DialoGPT with Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a web application that can communicate with users via a chat interface.

For the frontend of my application, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive chat interface. Additionally, we will be using jQuery to handle the HTTP requests that are made to the backend server.


Usage;
Interact with the bot:

Type a message in the input field.
Press "Enter" to receive a response from the bot.
